- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Laura
- 📈 I’m interested in learning and improving as much as I can
- 🐍 I'm a huge Python fan, but I've also been learning a bit more about Javascript and Typescript frameworks 😉
- 👩🏽‍💻 I work as a Middle QA, and I'm really enjoying communicating and working on new challenges!
- Some frameworks and languages I'm used to are Selenium, Cypress, RestSharp, Appium and little bit of k6 - With C#, .NET and Typescript/Javascript
